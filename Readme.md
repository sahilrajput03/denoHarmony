## Deno's Hub

You may run in **watch mode** by:

```
denon <file>
nodemon <file>
```

**#Note**: .denonrc file is required to specify appropriate permissions configuration. Denon watches for .env by default.
**#Note**: nodemon.json file is required to config deno run with the nodemon, and to be able watch for the .env file too, which is configured inside it.

## Thanks.
